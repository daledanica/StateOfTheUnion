# StateOfTheUnion
CS-361 Software Engineering I - Application

This is my UI application that asks the user for a state in the U.S.
It returns facts about the state. 
Then, it asks the user if they would like learn a fun fact, a piece of history about the state, choose another state, or quit.
It will continue to ask until the user quits.
